## Problem Statement

### Introduction
In the practical world there are many situations when we need to use something
other than a human to explore a particular area. It would provide plenty of advantages 
if such an area is able to be navigated and mapped accurately using an autonomous 
navigation algorithm, mainly due to the extensive amount of applications it would provide.

### Solution
This is what is hoped to be implemented with "Xplore". A omni-directional, room mapping
robot that will ideally be able to map a room using sensor measurements of all objects.
Xplore will be mostly autonomous when exploring a room, however the user should have some level
of control which will mostly be through a switching input. Also, Xplore may use a display to
inform the user of any critical information. As the design of xplore is expanded upon, the exact hardware 
components and more io will be introduced.
