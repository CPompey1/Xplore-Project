In the development of robots we find that the most efficient are the ones that can most flexibly move and sense the environment around them. One method of movement that would be worth exploring is that of omnidirectional vehicles. That is what will be implemented in Pac-bot. It would also gradually create a map of the environment by exploring and measuring the distance between itself and another object.
